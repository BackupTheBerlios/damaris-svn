Installing into private directory
=================================

For whatever reason, it might be useful to install the
python frontend into a private directory.
Here are some examples on how to do it:

	python setup.py install --home=/opt/damaris-private
or
	python setup.py install --home=$HOME/devel/damaris-installed

To start Damaris use for example:

	/opt/damaris-private/bin/DAMARIS
