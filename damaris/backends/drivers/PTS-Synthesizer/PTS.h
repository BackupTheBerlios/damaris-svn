/**
   \brief %PTS Synthesizer driver for phase and preselected frequency

   The driver can switch phase during experiment, the accuracy is determined by the number of connected phase selector lines.
   Frequency support will be soon available, one frequency can be selected, which is configured before the experiment.
   The Synthesizer is driven in transperent mode, i.e. no latch is used. Therefore phase information is added to all states.
   If no phase is defined by an analogout instruction, the default phase is taken.
