	Abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance field gradient methods provide a powerful tool with which to study translational molecular diffusion. Techniques described use the huge static field gradients available in the stray field of superconducting magnets or in specially designed anti-Helmholtz magnets. The experimental concepts and the dynamical ranges of these methods are discussed in detail and carefully compared with established pulsed-field gradient methods. Large-magnitude static field gradients combined with short radiofrequency-pulse spacings give access to very small diffusion coefficients (down to 10-15 m2 s-1) and a high spatial resolution (molecular displacements down to 10 nm). The advantages of static field gradient techniques are demonstrated with several experimental applications selected from the fields of polymer physics, supercooled melts, and biomedical research.},

The technique uses a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill of pulse train that attenuates the effects of diffusion due to the background gradient, interspersed with an alternating pulsed field gradient sequence (APFG) that attenuates the observed echo in the presence of the known applied gradient. Calculations for the observed echo amplitude are presented that show the APFG technique eliminates contributions from the cross term between the background and applied gradients. Results of tests of the technique are presented for the measurement of D in H2O in the presence of G0 \~{} 160 G/cm.

	Abstract = {In a variety of fields of spectroscopy, many apodization functions are presently available that can be used to multiply a time-domain signal, so that after Fourier transformation the resolution will be improved, in the sense that the linewidths will be reduced in the frequency domain. Until recently, these functions increased either the resolution or the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and always one at the expense of the other. Recently a function that may be used to increase either resolution, S/N, or both simultaneously was introduced. A mathematical explanation of how the function operates is presented, along with an improved version of the original form. Results are reported that demonstrate an increase in SIN of up to a factor of two, while simultaneously increasing resolution. Also presented are some problems that may arise from the use of this function, as well as a comparison with the commonly used Gaussian apodization.},

@article{Hurlimann:2001lr,
	Abstract = {We analyze the evolution of magnetization following any series of radiofrequency pulses in strongly inhomogeneous fields, with particular attention to diffusion and relaxation effects. When the inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field approaches or exceeds the strength of the RF field, the magnetization has contributions from different coherence pathways. The diffusion or relaxation induced decay of the signal amplitude is in general nonexponential, even if the sample has single relaxation times T1, T2 and a single diffusion coefficient D. In addition, the shape of the echo depends on diffusion and relaxation. It is possible to separate contributions from different coherence pathways by phase cycling of the RF pulses. The general analysis is tested on stray field measurements using two different pulse sequences. We find excellent agreement between measurements and calculations. The inversion recovery sequence is used to study the relaxation effects. We demonstrate two different approaches of data analysis to extract the relaxation time T1. Finite pulse width effects on the timing of the echo formation are also studied. Diffusion effects are analyzed using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence. In a stray field of a constant gradient g, we find that unrestricted diffusion leads to nonexponential signal decay versus echo number N, but within experimental error the diffusion attenuation is still only a function of g2Dt3EN, where tE is the echo spacing.},

It is shown that the use of long gradient pulses ({$[$}delta{$]$} \~{}a2/D) create the illusion of smaller pores if a narrow pulse approximation is assumed, while ignoring the presence of significant wall relaxation can lead to both an underestimation of the pore dimensions and a misidentification of the pore geometry.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion and flow can be measured very delicately and accurately using an NMR system. The essence of the method is that motion of magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field and a magnetic gradient results in those nuclei changing their Larmor precession frequency and their phase angle in the field. Since NMR can be set up to measure the number of nuclei at specific phase angles, the motion of groups of nuclei can be determined very accurately. Self-diffusion of molecules was first measured by Hahn in 1950. Self-diffusion of molecules and flow of molecules can be separated in an NMR measurement as was shown by Carr and Purcell in 1954. This review describes some techniques of NMR diffusion and flow measurements, and a method of plotting phase angles of isochromatic spin groups for theoretical analyses and simulations of NMR experiments. },

@article{PhysRevB.1.2048,
	Abstract = {A theoretical and experimental study is made of the response of a two-ingredient spin system when repeatedly pulsed at resonance by a number of 90$\,^{\circ}$ rf pulses. With a long train of 90$\,^{\circ}$ pulses, a sustained chain of solid echoes was produced for Na23 in NaF. The peak echo amplitude was found to decay nonexponentially for short times (i.e., the first few echoes), settling down for long times to an exponential decay characterized by a time constant T2?. A theoretical expression for T2? derived in a similar manner to that for a single-ingredient spin system, described previously by Waugh and Wang and by Mansfield and Ware, does not fit the experimental data. A more general theoretical approach to the multiple-pulse experiments is developed, based on the use of a logarithmic operator. Using this formalism together with a line-narrowing model similar to Anderson's theory of spectral line narrowing in solids in the presence of an exchange interaction, a new expression for T2? is derived. Some related long-pulse experiments have been performed in which the Na23 magnetization following an initial 90$\,^{\circ}$ pulse is spin-locked in a low rf field. These experiments simulate the mean rf field in the multiple-pulse experiment. Oscillation of the spin-locked magnetization is observed. Theoretical expressions are derived which describe these oscillations, and their relation to the multiple-pulse experiments is discussed. Mentioned briefly are some multiple-pulse experiments on F19 in CaF2 doped with paramagnetic impurities; also discussed briefly are some earlier multiple-pulse double-resonance experiments carried out on both nuclear species in NaF.},

	Abstract = {An experimental and theoretical study is made of the response of a single-magnetic-species spin system to a coherent train of resonant 90$\,^{\circ}$ rf pulses of spacing 2?, following at time ? an initial preparatory 90$\,^{\circ}$ pulse. The rf phase of the coherent pulses is shifted 90$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the initial pulse. It is shown that this pulse sequence will produce a sustained "solid-echo" chain for times much greater than T2, i.e., approaching the spin-lattice relaxation time. This therefore shows promise as a new method of chemical-shift measurement in solids, as well as a direct method of measuring the rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation time T1?. Except for a small initial oscillation, the amplitudes of successive even or odd echo maxima in CaF2 are found to decay exponentially with a time constant T2?. It is shown theoretically that a simple diagonal assumption for the density matrix plus the rotational symmetry properties of the dipolar Hamiltonian to 90$\,^{\circ}$ pulses could explain the observed ?-5 dependence of T2? as well as the oscillatory effect. Numerical evaluation of the magnitude of T2? based on a cumulant-moment approximation gives good agreement with experiment.

Further related experiments have been performed by spin-locking the F19 magnetization in long pulses of low amplitude. These experiments are intended to simulate the multiple-pulse sequences by replacing the coherent-pulse train with its mean field. The results reveal considerable oscillatory effects due to mutual exchange of energy between the Zeeman and dipolar subsystems in the rotating reference frame. A theoretical analysis is given which supports these effects. An estimate is made of the Zeeman dipolar cross-relaxation time, and is compared with Provotorov's theory as modified by Walstedt.

In the multiple-pulse experiment, the "solid-echo" amplitude modulation may be ascribed to mutual energy exchange between the rf Zeeman energy in the zeroth Fourier harmonic of the pulse train (the mean pulse field) and the dipolar energy. Because of the higher harmonics in the Fourier expansion, however, the initial oscillatory effects disappear as ? increases.},

@article{Hrovat:1981fj,
	Abstract = {In NMR diffusion measurements, the application of pulsed magnetic field gradients can produce additional magnetic field gradients, residual gradients, which decay slowly after the pulse. Results indicate that at least two types of residual gradients are present. These are quantitatively measured and analyzed. The consequences of their presence have been carefully examined with significant results for Fourier transform experiments and pulsed gradient calibration. For example, multicomponent systems may mistakenly exhibit different diffusion rates for each component when Fourier transform techniques are used. The residual gradient, since it distorts the background magnetic field gradient, may increase the sensitivity to mismatch of the pulsed gradients as well as affect the calibration of the pulsed gradient. It is demonstrated that the lineshape can be an accurate indicator of the magnetic field gradient. Several factors which may distort the lineshape are analyzed and found not to be critical. As a consequence of these findings, an optimal procedure is described for the measurement of diffusion rates using the pulsed gradient method.},

Both methods are applied to solid lithium as a simple test case. The results show that under the given conditions SFG NMR and PFG NMR can provide tracer diffusion coefficients for 7Li diffusion down to about 10-14 and 10-13 m2/s, respectively. SFG and PFG NMR are complementary methods. The paper demonstrates advantages and disadvantages of each method with a concrete example and why it is desirable to be able to apply both methods to the same sample.},

	Abstract = {To restore nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals distorted by read-out gradient transients, it is necessary to know the time shape of the gradient. The authors show that the time shape of the gradient can be evaluated by using the ratio of free induction decay (FID) to its first derivative coming from a small sample placed inside the RF coil. In computer simulation and experiments, the gradients obtained using this approximation of the actual solution agreed well with the true gradients. The advantages to the method proposed here are: no additional apparatus is required to measure the gradient and the method may be utilised even for very small bore magnets without degrading gradient performance. },
